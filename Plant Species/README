# 🌱 Plant Species Power BI Analysis

## 📝 Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides an in-depth analysis of plant species data. The dashboard is designed to help users explore distributions, trends, and key insights related to plant species diversity, classification, and geographical presence.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of plant species by family, genus, and region.
- Understand diversity and richness of plant types in various environments.
- Highlight key metrics such as total species, most common families, and geographic spread.
- Enable interactive exploration through filters and visuals.

## 📂 Data Source
- **Dataset:** Plant species data
- **Source Type:** Imported data
- **Contents:** Species Name, Family, Genus, Region, Conservation Status, Occurrence, and Description.

## 📈 Key Visuals and Features
- **Bar Charts:** Most common plant families and genera.
- **Map Visuals:** Geographic distribution of plant species.
- **Donut/Pie Charts:** Proportion of species by conservation status or family.
- **KPI Cards:** Total number of species, regions covered, and protected species.
- **Tables:** Detailed view of species with filter and sort options.
- **Slicers:** Filter by family, region, conservation status, or genus.

## 🧮 Data Modeling
- Relationships created between tables (e.g., Families, Species, Regions)
- **Calculated Columns / Measures (examples):**
  - `Total Species = COUNTROWS('Species')`
  - `Endangered Species = CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('Species'), 'Species'[Conservation Status] = "Endangered")`
  - `Species Richness per Region = DISTINCTCOUNT('Species'[Species Name])`

## 🧠 Insights
- Identify biodiversity hotspots and regions with high species richness.
- Track distribution and concentration of threatened species.
- Understand taxonomic patterns and prevalence of plant families.

## 🛠 How to Use
1. Open the `.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
2. Use slicers to filter data by family, region, conservation status, or genus.
3. Hover over visuals for additional details and tooltips.
4. Navigate between report pages using the tabs at the bottom.

## 📌 Notes
- The dashboard is optimized for use in Power BI Desktop.
- All visuals are interactive and respond to filtering.
- Data cleaning and transformation were performed using Power Query in Power BI.
